#How to set up
1.	Install GitHub: https://desktop.github.com/
	This is a bundle of a command-line Git shell and a GUI version GitHub. I personally recommend to use the command line and get used to it since most employers look down to the GUI version. It's not that scary, just no more than 10 commands.
	But for setting up, we will use the GUI version since it's easier and it can connect your GitHub account to this project.

2.	Open GitHub and sign in to your account.

3.	Click the plus sign on the top-left corner. Under the "clone" tab, you will see our project. Clone it to wherever you want on your computer.

4.	Now you can launch Unity, and click "open". Choose the project folder, which should be "VGDC-ProjectCursed".
	
5.	And you are all set!

6.	If you can't set up the local git repository, feel free to ask me(James) or post on the Facebook page.
