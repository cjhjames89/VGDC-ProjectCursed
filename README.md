#How to set up
1.	Install GitHub: https://desktop.github.com/
	This is a bundle of a command-line Git shell and a GUI version GitHub. I personally recommend to use the command line and get used to it since most employers look down to the GUI version. It's not that scary, just no more than 10 commands.
	But for setting up, we will use the GUI version since it's easier and it can connect your GitHub account to this project.

2.	Open GitHub and sign in to your account.

3.	Click the plus sign on the top-left corner. Under the "clone" tab, you will see our project. Clone it to wherever you want on your computer.

4.	Verify. Open Git Shell and cd to your project folder. Type "git remote -v" to check if the two URL is same as the URL of this project.

```c#
/*For windows, to change the current directory to another disk/partition/volume/drive, just type the letter of the volume followed by a colon: */
C:\> d:
D:\>

//To change directory within a drive, type "cd " followed by the relative path:
D:\> cd UCI\
D:\UCI\> cd VGDC\Projects\
D:\UCI\VGDC\Projects\> 

//Dot, ".", means current directory. Double dot, "..", means parent directory:
D:\UCI\VGDC\> cd ..
D:\UCI\>
```

5.	Now you can launch Unity, and click "open". Choose the project folder, which should be "VGDC-ProjectCursed".
	
6.	And you are all set!

7.	If you can't set up the local git repository, feel free to ask me(James) or post on the Facebook page.
